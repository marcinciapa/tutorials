Code for [Getting Started With Python course](https://www.amigoscode.com/courses/python)

# What I learned

## Getting Started

- `pyenv` is a convinient tool for managing multiple versions of Python (as NVM for NPM or `sdkman` for Java).
- Created and run "Hello World" program in Python

## The Basics

- Defining variables in Python doesn't require declaring type, when another type is assigned to the same variable, they
  are re-declared. However, specifying a type as also possible after `:`.
- Type of the variable can be obtained using `type(variable)` function
- Python is a dynamically typed language - types of variables are checked at runtime
- Indentations matter in Python. Sub-procedures need to be indented.
