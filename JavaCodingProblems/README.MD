This is a module containing solution implementation from 'Java Coding Problems' book (ISBN: 978-1789801415).

The problems and solutions presented in the book are a perfect warmup before diving into more complex coding tasks,
helping to set the mind for coding and problem-solving.

It's also a good opportunity to 'Go back to basics', helping to not forget what Java is all about.
